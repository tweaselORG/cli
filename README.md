# Tweasel CLI

> Command-line tool for the libraries of the tweasel project.

The tweasel project provides various JavaScript libraries for instrumenting and analyzing mobile apps and their traffic. `tweasel-cli` is a command-line tool that provides a convenient wrapper around these libraries for common use cases, so you don't have to write any code. Currently, support for [`cyanoacrylate`](https://github.com/tweaselORG/cyanoacrylate) and [`TrackHAR`](https://github.com/tweaselORG/TrackHAR) is implemented.

The tweasel CLI provides the following commands:

* `record-traffic`: Record the traffic of an Android or iOS app in HAR format.

  The app will be installed and started automatically on the device or emulator. Its traffic will be then recorded for the specified duration and saved as a HAR file at the end. You can either record the traffic of the entire system or only the specified app (default on Android, currently unsupported on iOS).

  The app can optionally be uninstalled automatically afterwards.
* `detect-tracking`: Detect tracking data transmissions from traffic in HAR format.

  The traffic in the specified HAR file will be analyzed using TrackHAR. The detected tracking data can be output as a human-readable table or as JSON.

More commands and support for the other libraries will be added soon.

If you want more control over the analysis, you can use the libraries directly. See the [README for cyanoacrylate](https://github.com/tweaselORG/cyanoacrylate).

## Installation

To use `tweasel-cli`, you need to have Node.js and Python 3.8 or greater installed. Depending on the device platform(s) you are interested in, you need to install different host dependencies. Take a look at the [README for appstraction](https://github.com/tweaselORG/appstraction#host-dependencies-for-android) and follow the instructions to install those.

You can then install the tweasel CLI using yarn or npm (you probably want to install it globally):

```sh
yarn global add tweasel-cli
# or `npm i -g tweasel-cli`
```

You can run the CLI using the `tweasel` command.

## `tweasel detect-tracking <HAR FILE>`

Detect tracking data transmissions from traffic in HAR format.

```
USAGE
  $ tweasel detect-tracking <HAR FILE> [--json] [--hide-unmatched] [--columns <value> | -x] [--sort <value>]
    [--filter <value>] [--output csv|json|yaml |  | [--csv | --no-truncate]] [--no-header | ]

ARGUMENTS
  <HAR FILE>  The path to the HAR file to analyze.

FLAGS
  -x, --extended         show extra columns
  --columns=<value>      only show provided columns (comma-separated)
  --csv                  output is csv format [alias: --output=csv]
  --filter=<value>       filter property by partial string matching, ex: name=foo
  --[no-]hide-unmatched  Hide requests that were not matched by any adapter.
  --no-header            hide table header from output
  --no-truncate          do not truncate output to fit screen
  --output=<option>      output in a more machine friendly format

  --sort=<value>         property to sort by (prepend '-' for descending)

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Detect tracking data transmissions from traffic in HAR format.

  By default, this will output a human-readable table of the detected tracking data for each requests. You can use
  various flags to adjust the way the tables are displayed. If you instead want a machine-readable output, use the
  --json flag.

  To show requests not matched by any adapter, use the --no-hide-unmatched flag.

EXAMPLES
  Detect tracking data transmissions in `app.har` and display them in table form, hiding requests to unsupported
  endpoints.

    $ tweasel detect-tracking app.har

  Detect tracking data transmissions in `app.har` and display them in table form, but show requests to unsupported
  endpoints.

    $ tweasel detect-tracking app.har --no-hide-unmatched

  Detect tracking data transmissions in `app.har` and display them in table form with additional details.

    $ tweasel detect-tracking app.har --extended

  Detect tracking data transmissions in `app.har` and output them as JSON.

## `tweasel record-traffic <APP FILE(S)>`

Record the traffic of an Android or iOS app in HAR format.

```
USAGE
  $ tweasel record-traffic <APP FILE(S)> [-p android|ios] [-t device|emulator] [--timeout <value>] [-o <value>]
    [--bypass-certificate-pinning] [--all-traffic] [--uninstall-app] [--grant-permissions]
    [--bypass-tracking-domain-resolution-check] [--ios-ip <value>] [--ios-proxy-ip <value>] [--ios-root-pw <value>]
    [--emulator-name <value>] [--emulator-snapshot-name <value>] [--emulator-headless] [--emulator-no-audio]
    [--emulator-ephemeral]

ARGUMENTS
  <APP FILE(S)>  The path to the app to analyze (.ipa on iOS, .apk on Android). Can be specified multiple times for
                 split APKs on Android.

FLAGS
  -o, --output=<value>                       The path to the HAR file to save the traffic to. If not specified, a file
                                             named <app ID>.har will be created in the current directory.
  -p, --platform=<option>                    The platform to run the app on (will be inferred from the first app file if
                                             not specified).
                                             <options: android|ios>
  -t, --run-target=<option>                  [default: device] The target to run the app on.
                                             <options: device|emulator>
  --all-traffic                              By default, only the traffic of the specified app is recorded on Android.
                                             Set this flag to record all traffic. On iOS, all system traffic is always
                                             recorded.
  --[no-]bypass-certificate-pinning          Bypass certificate pinning on Android using objection. Enabled by default.
  --bypass-tracking-domain-resolution-check  By default, we assert that a few tracking domains can be resolved. This is
                                             useful to ensure that no DNS tracking blocker is interfering with the
                                             results. Set this flag to disable this behavior.
  --[no-]grant-permissions                   Automatically grant all permissions to the app. Enabled by default.
  --timeout=<value>                          [default: 60] How long to run the app and record its traffic for (in
                                             seconds).
  --uninstall-app                            Whether to uninstall the app after the analysis.

EMULATOR FLAGS
  --emulator-ephemeral              Whether to discard all changes when exiting the emulator.
  --emulator-headless               Whether to start the emulator in headless mode.
  --emulator-name=<value>           The name of the emulator to start. If you don't provide this, you need to start the
                                    emulator yourself.
  --emulator-no-audio               Whether to start the emulator with audio disabled.
  --emulator-snapshot-name=<value>  The name of a snapshot to reset the emulator to before starting.

IOS FLAGS
  --ios-ip=<value>        The IP address of the iOS device.
  --ios-proxy-ip=<value>  The IP address of the host running the proxy to set up on the iOS device.
  --ios-root-pw=<value>   [default: alpine] The password of the root user on the iOS device.

DESCRIPTION
  Record the traffic of an Android or iOS app in HAR format.

  The app will be installed and started automatically on the device or emulator. Its traffic will be then recorded for
  the specified duration and saved as a HAR file at the end. You can either record the traffic of the entire system or
  only the specified app (default on Android, currently unsupported on iOS).

  The app can optionally be uninstalled automatically afterwards.

EXAMPLES
  Record the traffic of the Android app `app.apk` for 60 seconds on a physical device.

    $ tweasel record-traffic app.apk

  Record the traffic of the iOS app `app.ipa` for 60 seconds on the physical iPhone with the IP 10.0.0.2. The host
  that runs the proxy has the IP 10.0.0.2.

    $ tweasel record-traffic app.ipa --ios-ip 10.0.0.3 --ios-proxy-ip 10.0.0.2

  Record the traffic of an Android app consisting of multiple split APKs.

    $ tweasel record-traffic app.apk config.en.app.apk config.xxhdpi.app.apk

  Record the traffic of `app.apk` for 30 seconds in the emulator called `my-emulator` and start that emulator
  automatically.

    $ tweasel record-traffic app.apk -t emulator --emulator-name my-emulator --timeout 30

  Record the traffic of `app.apk` for 10 seconds and save the HAR file to `traffic.har` in your home directory.

    $ tweasel record-traffic app.apk -o ~/traffic.har --timeout 10

  Install and run `app.apk` but record the traffic of the entire system.

    $ tweasel record-traffic app.apk --all-traffic
```
